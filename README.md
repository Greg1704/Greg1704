# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Gregorio Firmani, I am a final-year Software Engineering student looking for new projects and opportunities.

## My Interests as a Developer

I enjoy working across the full development stack, building both user-facing interfaces and robust backend systems. My passion lies in continuously learning emerging technologies and tackling complex problems through creative solutions. I find satisfaction in understanding how different parts of an application work together and optimizing the entire development process.

## My Goals in Web3

I'm eager to dive deeper into Web3 technologies and understand the fundamentals of blockchain development, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. My goal is to build practical experience by developing my own projects in this space, exploring areas like DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and decentralized governance systems. I'm particularly interested in how Web3 can create more transparent and user-owned digital experiences.
